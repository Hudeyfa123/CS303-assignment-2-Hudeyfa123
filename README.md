# CS303-assignment-2-Hudeyfa123

Introduction
This report explains the process of running the two data structures implemented for the assignment:

Single Linked List: A custom implementation of a singly linked list.
Stack using Vector: A stack implemented using C++ vectors.
Both classes include various functionalities, such as adding and removing elements, checking if the list or stack is empty, and searching for elements.

File Structure
The project consists of the following files:

Single Linked List Implementation:

SingleLinkedList.h - Contains the declarations for the singly linked list.
SingleLinkedList.cpp - Contains the definitions and implementation for the singly linked list.
Stack Using Vector:

StackUsingVector.h - Contains the declarations for the stack using a vector.
StackUsingVector.cpp - Contains the definitions and implementation for the stack.
Main Program:

main.cpp - A driver program that tests the functionality of both the singly linked list and the stack.
README.md - Instructions for compiling and running the program.

Compilation and Execution Instructions
How to Compile the Program
Follow these steps to compile the program:

Ensure you have the following files in the same directory:

SingleLinkedList.h
SingleLinkedList.cpp
StackUsingVector.h
StackUsingVector.cpp
main.cpp

Expected Output
When you run the program, you should see the following operations being performed and their results printed to the console:

Single Linked List Operations:

Insert values at the front and back of the list.
Retrieve and display the front and back elements.
Display the size of the list.
Remove elements and show the updated list status.
Stack Operations Using Vector:

Push integer values onto the stack.
Display the top element of the stack.
Calculate and display the average of the elements.
Pop elements from the stack and display the updated status.
